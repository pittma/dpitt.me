       <h1>Wittgenstein's Language Games</h1>
	 
       <article>
         

         <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In <em>Remarks on Colour</em>, Ludwig Wittgenstein explores a set of puzzles through colors which are meant to illuminate a specific type of logical incongruence. One such example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{A is red and A is blue.}
\]</span></p>
<p>This example is the most salient for the purposes of this post, but before I try and explain why, I’d like to try explain what point Wittgenstein was trying to elucidate with this puzzle.</p>
<h2 id="language-games">2 Language Games</h2>
<p>Wittgenstein, by the end of his life had resolved to understand language in its ordinary setting as a collection of <em>language games</em>. One such language game was that of the builder and their apprentice, where the only words were <em>block</em>, <em>pillar</em>, <em>slab</em>, and <em>beam</em>. In it, the apprentice understood the words as commands and delivered the object which requested by their builder. The point of this game was to show that language as a singular game was simply not rich enough to be of any use. Wittgenstein said that human existence would be reduced to primitive forms in the presence of a singular language game.</p>
<p>Another, more cogent language game is that involving colors. The colors language game shows the intermingling of two discrete language games. Looking again at the statement</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{A is red and A is blue.}
\]</span></p>
<p>We have two distinct games at play: First, that of simple logic. It arises in the use of <em>and</em>. Second, colors, which tend to have a universal application. As he points out further into <em>Remarks on Colour</em>, a thing cannot be reddish green.</p>
<p>Now, when viewed as distinct modalities, there is no violation of what one could imagine the “rules” of a language game might be: A can be red, A can be blue, and conjunction is standard tool in logic. It’s only when we try to put them together that we find that they cease to be logical. It’s this point that Wittgenstein was trying to illustrate. There isn’t a singular, univeral structure which language can be reduced to<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="language-games-in-mathematics">3 Language Games in Mathematics</h2>
<p>Wittgenstein also believed that language games were present in mathematics. Arguably, this is in opposition to the viewpoint of earlier Wittgenstein and his mentor, Bertand Russell, who believed that math could be reduced to logic but more on that later. For now, I would like to consider some examples, in logic in fact, which I consider to be in line with this interpretation of mathematics as a collection of language games.</p>
<h3 id="linear-logic">3.1 Linear Logic</h3>
<p>Linear logic is a form of logic which considers not only logical expressions, but also tracks resources, or the use of those expressions. In linear logic, each variable, or proposition, must be introduced, and then <em>consumed</em>, or used exactly once. Here’s an example:</p>
<!-- Consider changing the narrative here. Instead of "a few examples", focus
     on linear logic and show that, at least in logic, we have the ! and ?
     modalities which act as vehicles _between_ the two games. -->
