           <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>To start this post, I’d like to state a disclaimer: I am a novice real-world Haskeller. My day-to-day work these days involves <a href="https://dpitt.me/talks/pt-impression">translating fancy types in Rust to Agda</a>, and then proving things about the resultant Agda code. That said, I’ve made various exploratory attempts at doing this mechanically. My latest venture is to use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-rust"><code>language-rust</code></a> to do the initial parsing, and then I take on translating one AST to another.</p>
<p>This post isn’t about that, though. It’s about my struggle to find a non-insanity-inducing way to deal with errors in a real, actual Haskell program.</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The State of The Art</h2>
<p>I spent nearly a day scouring the Web looking at various posts by Haskellers—on their blogs, on stack overflow, I even saw one show up on the software engineering Stack Exchange site. Apparently, this is such a miserable problem it requires a software engineering principles-level discussion.</p>
<p>What I’d like do is to list a few of the things I read, drew inspiration from, or ones from which I perhaps just gained some philosophical wisdom. I’ll talk about the good parts, the bad parts, then ultimately cover why it wasn’t quite satisfactory for how I’d like for such a thing to work.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions-best-practices-in-haskell-snoyman">1. <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/11/exceptions-best-practices-haskell">Exceptions Best Practices in Haskell (Snoyman)</a></h3>
<p>This post is probably the premier exposition on the topic. My primary takeaway here was regarding the cases where you do, and where you <em>don’t</em>, need to be parametric over the error or exception types. The position taken in the post was that, well, you should always be parametric on account of limitation imposed on a consumer of your error-throwing code in terms of its composability. However, I found that this perspective, the one borne from a desire for flexibility, a bit too rigid. If it’s the case that you’re building a self-contained application, a singular, top-level error type is perfectly reasonable.</p>
