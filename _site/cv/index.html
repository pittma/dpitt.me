<p><strong>10/2021 - Current</strong></p>
<p>We do weird and innovative Linux things that I can’t really talk
about, both in the kernel and in userspace, to serve Intel’s
hyper-scale customers.</p>
<h2 id="auxon-corporation">Auxon Corporation</h2>
<h3 id="principal-and-founding-engineer">Principal and Founding Engineer</h3>
<p><strong>07/2018 - 10/2021</strong></p>
<p>For the first half of my time at Auxon, I continued my exploration
into applying proof theoretical methods for checking software at both
compile time and runtime.</p>
<p>Once Auxon moved on from developing high-assurance software itself, I
began focussing on the customer-facing edges of our product, finding
that putting myself in the shoes of potential users came
naturally. During this time I developed and implemented Modality’s
log, check, and cumulative report features.</p>
<h4 id="additional-accomplishments">Additional Accomplishments</h4>
<ul>
<li>We made a runtime in Rust on top of seL4. In this runtime, we went
through great lengths to extend the guarantees that seL4 provides to
also be checkable at compile-time through techniques which can be
summarized as “type-level programming”.</li>
<li>I owned the architecture-agnostic implementation for that runtime
that used type-level induction to provide a mechanism for
architecture-agnostic memory hierarchies.</li>
<li>I Designed and implemented a memory-mapped registers library (in
Rust) that provided:
<ul>
<li>Compile-type checked writes (for values known a priori).</li>
<li>A proof-carrying approach for runtime checking.</li>
<li>Complete proofs of that library’s correctness in Agda.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I built a tool in Haskell that translates Rust types (and therefore
type-level programs) to Agda. I spoke about an early iteration of
this at Strange Loop 2018.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="polysync">Polysync</h2>
<h3 id="principal-engineer">Principal Engineer</h3>
<p><strong>11/2017 - 07/2018</strong></p>
<p>I came to PolySync to contribute to the high-assurance automotive
runtime they were building working as a hybrid proof / software
engineer. PolySync intended to use my work and research to find ways
to blur the line between proof and program to instill further
confidence in the integrity of the software they developed.</p>
<h4 id="additional-accomplishments-1">Additional Accomplishments</h4>
<ul>
<li>We made a toolchain for writing seL4 tasks in Rust.</li>
<li>I designed a distributed system whose core logic was session types
predicated on Atkey-style indexed monads translated to Rust to run
on seL4.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intel-corporation-1">Intel Corporation</h2>
<h3 id="sr.-cloud-software-engineer">Sr. Cloud Software Engineer</h3>
<p><strong>12/2014-11/2017</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I led a team that built a distributed execution engine that tried to
model the data center as a category—states as objects, transitions
as morphisms (ask me more about this, it was fun).</li>
<li>I worked on making persistent memory useful in cloud environments (Go/etcd)</li>
<li>I helped design and build a modular and flexible telemetry system for use in the data center.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vmware">VMware</h2>
<h3 id="sr.-member-of-technical-staff">Sr. Member of Technical Staff</h3>
<p><strong>12/2012-12/2014</strong></p>
<p>I was one of the first 10 developers working on VMware’s public cloud
platform, vCHS. We made a globally distributed system which could
deploy complete private VMware environments to the cloud in
minutes. It did this through a number of interesting technologies
including but not limited to: CQRS &amp; Event Sourcing, AMQP, Cassandra,
(and all of its finicky eventual consistency idiosyncrasies), and a
homegrown Paxos implementation—which I was later responsible for
replacing with Zookeeper.</p>
<h2 id="enterhost-consuro">Enterhost / Consuro</h2>
<h3 id="system-administrator">System Administrator</h3>
<p><strong>2/2012-12/2012</strong></p>
<p>At Enterhost, a hosting provider, and its MSP arm Consuro, I was
responsible for designing and then implementing and/or installing
medium-sized networks involving VMware infrastructure, typically on
customer premises with disaster recovery environments collocated at
Enterhost’s datacenter.</p>
<h2 id="wm-automotive">WM Automotive</h2>
<h3 id="system-administrator-1">System Administrator</h3>
<p><strong>7/2008-2/2012</strong></p>
<p>I was the primary IT provider for a midsize enterprise—an aftermarket
automotive parts distributor and retailer. During the time I was
there, I rebuilt their technology infrastructure from the ground up.</p>
<p>This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network overhaul to include company-owned stores on the LAN.</li>
<li>Virtualizing the CRM/ERP software stack for the B2B arm of the
business.</li>
<li>The deployment of Windows’ enterprise stack (Exchange / Active
Directory), desktop imaging and deployment.</li>
<li>Centralized SAN-based storage.</li>
<li>An active/passive disaster recovery plan.</li>
</ul>
