Rust really hits a sweet spot with respect to programming languages on
account of a) its usefulness when working at a low level, coupled with
b) its style of type system. Because of a), Rust can be—and is—used
in places which tend to safety-critical: cyber-physical systems,
autonomous vehicle infrastructure, robotics, etc. When building
systems for these safety-critical environments, one also often
formally proves properties about their software. That’s where b) comes
in.

···

Rust’s type system is borne from the same ilk as those used in proof
assistants like Agda, Coq, or Lean. Because of this, we can use Rust’s
type system in similar ways we’d use a proof assistant to produce
safer and more correct programs. This is envisioned by reducing the
language of these disparate systems into the lingua franca of type
theory.

This talk will explore using (and abusing) Rust’s type system to mimic
the proofs one writes about their Rust programs while also enumerating
how this mimicry is derived from common ground in the worlds of types
or categories.
