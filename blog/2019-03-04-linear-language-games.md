# Introduction

In _Remarks on Colour_, Ludwig Wittgenstein explores a set of puzzles through
colors which are meant to illuminate a specific type of logical incongruence.
One such example:

$$
\text{A is red and A is blue.}
$$

This example is the most salient for the purposes of this post, but before I
try and explain why, I'd like to explain what point Wittgenstein was trying
to elucidate with this puzzle.

# Language Games

Wittgenstein, by the end of his life had resolved to understand language in its
ordinary setting as a collection of _language games_. One such language game
was that of the builder and their apprentice, where the only words were _block_,
_pillar_, _slab_, and _beam_. In it, the apprentice understood the words as
commands and delivered the object which requested by their builder. The point of
this game was to show that language as a singular game was simply not rich
enough to be of any use. Wittgenstein said that human existence would be reduced
to primitive forms in the presence of a singular language game.

Another, more cogent language game is that involving colors. The colors language
game shows the intermingling of two discrete language games. Looking again at
the statement

$$
\text{A is red and A is blue.}
$$

We have two distinct games at play: First, that of simple logic. It arises in
the use of _and_. Second, colors, which tend to have a universal application.
As he points out further into _Remarks on Colour_, a thing cannot be reddish
green.

Now, when viewed as distinct modalities, there is no violation of what one could
imagine the "rules" of a language game might be: A can be red, A can be blue,
and conjunction is standard tool in logic. It's only when we try to put them
together that we find that they cease to be logical. It's this point that
Wittgenstein was trying to illustrate. There isn't a singular, universal
structure which language can be reduced to<sup>[1]</sup>.

# Language Games in Mathematics

Wittgenstein also believed that language games were present in mathematics.
Arguably, this is in opposition to the viewpoint of earlier Wittgenstein and
his mentor, Bertand Russell, who believed that math could be reduced to logic
but more on that later. For now, I would like to consider some examples, in
logic in fact, which I consider to be in line with this interpretation of 
mathematics as a collection of language games.

### 3.1 Linear Logic

Linear logic is a form of logic which considers not only logical expressions,
but also tracks resources, or the use of those expressions. In linear logic,
each variable, or proposition, must be introduced, and then _consumed_, or used
exactly once. Here's an example:

<!-- Consider changing the narrative here. Instead of "a few examples", focus
     on linear logic and show that, at least in logic, we have the ! and ?
     modalities which act as vehicles _between_ the two games. -->
