title: Using Emacs's org-mode As Your Zettelkästen
subtitle: (And some editorializing on the foundations of mathematics)
---


I like to write. I don't do it as often as I'd like to, but
nonetheless I do like to do it. I've found that one of the best
exercises for increasing the bandwidth of the passageway from my brain
to my fingers is superfluous note taking. Couple this Good Thing with
a Could Appear Like A Good Thing But Is Dubious At Best Thing, namely
ADHD/anxiety-induced procrastinatory over-organizing, one could
imagine that how I choose to organize those notes is something that I
(superfluously) think about. I've tried them all, notebooks, Evernote,
Google Keep, [[https://github.com/pittma/notes][even a custom markdown-to-jekyll app that was synched by
Dropbox]]. However, when I switched to Emacs about 2 years ago and started using
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], it, as a medium, really stuck. Since then I've just been
spinning and churning with nearly no success on how to organize my org
file(s). And then, about a week ago, I encountered [[https://www.srid.ca/2010101.html][~neuron~]] in the
/[[https://haskellweekly.news][Haskell Weekly]]/ newsletter, and because I'm prone to buy wholesale
anything a smart person says about note-taking, my interest was
piqued. The ~neuron~ author linked to this [[https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125][Zettelkästen overview]],
which I promptly devoured and, well, I /had/ to do it. Please read
what I linked above for a nice narrative on Zettelkasten's
origins. What follows is just a skeletal exposition.

** Zettelkästen

Literally "note box", the original zettlekästen was a piece of
furniture with index card drawers, six-by-six, like one of those bygone
cabinets you used to see at the library for filing books' locations
with Dewey Decimal Classification. Those index
cards followed four simple rules:

1. *A unique id.*[fn:id]
1. *One idea per card.*
1. *Tag each idea/card (optionally).*
1. *Each idea/card /links/ to related ideas.*

Given these rules, one can begin to build a cache of knowledge linked
together /almost/ like neurons, but /definitely/ like a graph that
you can explore from any ingress "idea vertex"[fn:conv]. It was this
broad transitivity of ideas that Zettelkästen's creator attributed
their prolificacy to.

Aha! A system. What kind of programmer would I be if I didn't automate as much
of this system as possible?

*** Step One: A ~zet~ Command

To begin, I wanted a way to "start the conversation" with my
zettelkästen. To me, that looked like just telling it about a new
topic. Something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ zet the sorites paradox
#+END_SRC

Which I would expect to open an editor and let me try and get this
thought from my head to my fingers with as few barriers as possible.
To this end, I created a small bash script to put on my path:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

set -e

ZROOT=${ZET_ROOT:=~/Dropbox/zet}

name="$ZROOT/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")"
content="*"

for word in $@; do
  name+="-$word"
  content+=" ${word^}"
done

if [ ! -e "$name.org" ]; then
  echo -e "$content\n\n#+FILETAGS:" > $name.org
fi

emacsclient -n $name.org
#+END_SRC

In terms of new code, this is the extent of it for this Org
mode-based zettelkästen. It pokes my pretty-much-always-running Emacs
server and opens a file whose name is prepended by the date and time,
followed by a dash-joined version of what I typed out at the command
line. As an example, right now it's March 26th, 2020 11:58 AM. So
given the ~zet~ command I ran above, I'd get a file created for me
called ~2020-03-26-1158-sorites-paradox.org~ and that file'd have the
following content:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Sorites Paradox

#+FILETAGS:
#+END_SRC

That I can go on to add content to:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+FILETAGS: :philosophy:fom:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox]]

A random philosophical point made very well about the foundations of
mathematics, from the Foundations of Mathematics mailing list no less.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Maybe ZFC is not the most natural framework in order to express
emergent properties related to the so-called Sorites Paradox. For
example, one neuron is not an intelligent brain. If we have a system
consisting of n neurons that is not an intelligent brain, to add one
neuron more to the system will not transform it into an intelligent
brain. The conclusion seems to be that there are not intelligent
brains in nature, which is contradicted by experience. Therefore,
sciences depending on emergent properties (neurology, biology, etc)
may need mathematical machinery which is not founded on ZFC.
#+END_QUOTE
#+END_SRC

*** Step Two: Links

Then let's say that I'd had a thought of my own (mind you, one that I
cannot and will not defend):

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Category Theory Metatheory

#+FILETAGS: :fom:philosophy:

*Category theory is a metatheory for mathematics.*

This idea brought to you by O explaining multiplication to T about how
it's /like/ addition, but you add one number to itself the other
number of times or something like that. It was this /like addition/
that sparked the thought, because it captures the arity of the
addition and multiplication operator, which is the point she was
making. They have the same shape. With Cartesian closed categories,
you can give a metatheory for this shape, i.e. with currying, and what
is math if not functions with some arity?
#+END_SRC

These two ideas are related insofar as one is a dilettante spitballing
about the foundations of mathematics and the other is an expert
sharing their insight about the foundations of mathematics. While I
was writing this post and thinking about the neuron to intelligent
brain paradox I remembered the nonsense my own brain synthesized while
O explained multiplication to T, so, yeah, I want to link these two
things in my zettelkästen—because that's the whole point!

I'll add that link by typing @@html: <kbd>@@ctrl@@html: </kbd>@@ +
@@html: <kbd>@@c@@html: </kbd>@@ @@html: <kbd>@@ctrl@@html: </kbd>@@ +
@@html: <kbd>@@l@@html: </kbd>@@ (~C-c C-l~) then start to type ~file~
which gives me this menu (I'm using [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Helm]]):

[[file:/images/zettel-file.png]]

When I hit @@html: <kbd>@@return@@html:</kbd>@@, it shows my list of
files in the current directory. That is, the directory of the file I'm
currently visiting:

[[file:/images/zettel-link.png]]

From here I can use the arrow keys or the completion search that Helm
gives me to find the note I'd like to link. Now I've got a link in
this note:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Category Theory Metatheory

#+FILETAGS: :fom:philosophy:

*Category theory is a metatheory for mathematics.*

This idea brought to you by O explaining multiplication to T about how
it's /like/ addition, but you add one number to itself the other
number of times or something like that. It was this /like addition/
that sparked the thought, because it captures the arity of the
addition and multiplication operator, which is the point she was
making. They have the same shape. With Cartesian closed categories,
you can give a metatheory for this shape, i.e. with currying, and what
is math if not functions with arity?

** Links

[[file:2020-03-26-1132-sorites-paradox.org]]
#+END_SRC

And if I'd like to follow it, I can just do @@html: <kbd>@@ctrl@@html:
</kbd>@@ + @@html: <kbd>@@c@@html: </kbd>@@ @@html: <kbd>@@ctrl@@html:
</kbd>@@ + @@html: <kbd>@@o@@html: </kbd>@@ (~C-c C-o~), or
~org-open-link-at-point~.

*** Step Three: Conversing (search)

Emacs Org mode has something called an /agenda/, that works as an
aggregator over a collection of Org files. It can do some pretty
amazing things like build a calendar for you, help you track your
habits, or organize your todo list. For us, now, though, we're going
to use its tag and string matching searches. It does require a little
setup in your ~init.el~ file to enable it, something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda)
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/org/notes/todo.org" "~/Dropbox/zet/"))
#+END_SRC

This results in the key sequence @@html: <kbd>@@ctrl@@html: </kbd>@@ +
@@html: <kbd>@@c@@html: </kbd>@@ @@html: <kbd>@@a@@html: </kbd>@@
being globally bound to opening Org Agenda, which looks like this:

[[file:/images/zettel-agenda.png]]

From here I can use @@html: <kbd>@@m@@html: </kbd>@@ to search by tag
matches, or @@html: <kbd>@@s@@html: </kbd>@@ for string matches, both
of which yield a list of matches:

[[file:/images/zettel-search.png]]

I can just arrow down and select one of the matching headlines to open
the file containing it.

** Valedictions

I've only started to build up my own zettelkästen, but it truly feels like
I've found a thing that fits, that /works/.

One important factor I've found with note taking, at least for me, is
for my note compendium to be append-only. I can't let myself go back
and pare down, edit and reëdit endlessly, because, unfailingly, I
always end up deleting everything since of course no organizational scheme I
can come up with is copacetic. The Zettelkästen approach actually
saves me from myself here because there's a single note per file, and
I'm almost never inundated with an entire list.

Using my zettelkästen stirs up that nostalgic feeling of going through
an old notebook every time I open it, and I'm only ever confronted with the
ideas I've asked of it. It narrows the aperture to a topic in a way
that saves me from myself and the consequences of the inexorable
self-loathing of an anxious mind. If anything from these last few
paragraphs resonates at all, I think it may work for you too.

Happy remembering!

[fn:id] This id needs to be unique, but is in general arbitrary and
        needn't necessarily be related to the note's content.
[fn:conv] Niklas Luhmann, the creator of the original zettelkästen
          occasionally referred to it as a "converation partner".
