title: "Hi, I'm dan."
---

<p>I'm a curious exister living in Portland, OR. I'm also a dad and a
  husband who currently programs computers for a living.</p>

<p>I like learning about type theory, proof theory, the philosophy of
  mathematics, and programming languages. For things that don't map
  back to work, I like to play and study music, read philosophy and
  fiction things, and do my best to get lost in a forest as often as
  possible.</p>
