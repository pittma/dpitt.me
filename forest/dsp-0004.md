And other annoying shit I've just made up.

This post is about dependency injection, a decoupling technique used
by programmers often with wanton abandon.

I'm not going to apologize for the above non-sequitur, but rather to
attempt to contextualize it. To begin, let's talk about Descartes:

### RenÃ© Descartes

Descartes is responsible for what is probably the penultimate
existential statement, eclipsed only by Shakespeare's _"to be or not
to be"_. Descartes's goes like this:

> Cogito ergo sum

Or

> I think, therefore I am.

Descartes's whole spiel was I can't doubt that I exist, because there
must be an "I" to doubt "I". That is, doubting my existence is
dependent on me existing and then doubting that I exist. An
interesting strange loop indeed.

### Computers

I recently found myself in an analogous existential argument about
when a component in a program commenced to exist.

This component is _dependent_ on another, and my coworker was of the
school of thought that this component's constructor should be
_decoupled_ from the injection of its dependency. Something like this:

```go
func main() {
	t1 := thing1.New()
	t2 := thing2.New()

	t1.BindThing2(t2)
}
```

However, _I_ believed that there was no reason for `t1` to even be
constructed if it there was not yet a t2 to meet its dependency. Like
this:

```go
func main() {
	t2 := thing2.New()
	t1 := thing1.New(thing2)
}
```

My coworker had a compelling argument. For us to reach optimal
clarity on his argument, we first must be _live_. That is,
__consistent__ on our understanding of a few things, so I must
digress.

### Microservices

A overloaded term which, to me, means Domain Driven Design, where each
"domain" is composed of subdomains (read: microservices) of
functionality.

For example, you have a group of services which mutate `Foo`s, and a
group of services which mutate `Bar`s. Each of these "domains" have
independent services which have discrete responsibilities such as
`paint-bar` or `flip-foo`. A service in the `Foo` domain has no
knowledge of a `Bar` whatsoever. Ideally not even through a
dependency like an ORM with both `Foo` and `Bar` declarations within
it. This complete, physical delineation protects each domain from the
other's faults.

### The Go Programming Language

An interesting thing about the design of the Go programming language
is that the language itself gently leads you down the path towards
something microservice-like even though your software may exist
completely in a single runtime. This is done through goroutines,
channels, and long-running loops. With Go, you find yourself writing a
distributed system, passing messages back and forth between disparate,
long-running, reactive loops all within a single runtime. It's
important to consider this mindset when considering my coworker's
argument.

So, given this context, when does a service commence existence? Is it
at instantiation? Or, when it becomes _useful_, with all its
subsystems in line and ready to take on the world?

What do you think?
