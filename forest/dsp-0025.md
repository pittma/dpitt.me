I started reading Bart Jacob's _Categorical Logic and Type Theory_
book today after seeing it mentioned on the Category Theory Zulip
because I've been seriously itching to get back into some mathy /
formalish stuff---life in hardware/software land just hasn't been
cutting it. I have heard a dozen times, I once even tried to slog
through the CwF paper, about the categorical semantics for type theory
being presheaf based as the presheaf apparently captures the notion of
type families. However, after reading through Chapter 0: Prospectus in
Jacobs' book, it sounds like he's going to use fibrations to talk
about indexing rather than presheafs, so I wanted to update my
understanding, precisely, on what a fibration actually was. After
having moderate success recently in asking it for help to remember how
to do `Either`-based error _returning_ rather than exception
_throwing_ in Haskell, I thought I'd chat with ChatGPT viz-a-viz
categorical fibrations. Here's the first thing it told me, which makes
sense:

<div class="multiline-quote">
[A] functor $$F: C \to D$$ between categories is called a fibration if
for every morphism $$f: X \to Y$$ in the codomain category D and for
every object $$X$$ in the domain category $$C$$, there exists:

1. An object $$\text{fib}(f)$$ in $$C$$, called the "fiber" or "preimage"
   of $$f$$ under $$F$$, and
1. A morphism $$p(f): \text{fib}(f) \to X$$ in $$C$$, called the 
   "lifting" or "pullback" of $$f$$ along $$F$$, such that $$F(p(f)) = f$$.
</div>

Ok GPT, I'm with you so far. So next I asked it if it could give me a
diagram. "Certainly!" it replied, followed with an example using the
category $$C$$, a category with two objects $$0$$ and $$1$$, and
*_only_* identity morphisms, and a functor $$F : C \to D$$ where $$D$$
was the category given by $$\langle\mathbb{N},\ \le\rangle$$. It then
gave an example of a $$p$$ that depended on a morphism in $$C$$ from
$$0$$ to $$1$$. Which, in its own example did not exist.

I corrected it, telling that there was no morphism $$f : 0 \to 1$$ in
$$C$$, so it gave me another example with $$C$$ being the two object
category with $$A$$ and $$B$$ and again only identity morphisms, and
$$D$$ being $$\textbf{Set}$$. And then proceeded to, three different
times, give me examples where the lifting morphism depended on a
morphism $$A \to B$$ in $$C$$.

Finally, it gave me an example that makes sense after I told it,
"That's the same example! You're still saying that id_A is A -> B, but
this is only the case if A and B are isomorphic, leaving C to be a
category with one object rather than two."

This time it told me that $$f$$ was $$\text{Id}_X$$ then $$p(f)$$ was
$$\text{Id}_a$$, but if $$f = \text{I}_Y$$, then there was no morphism
that lifts $$f$$ in $$C$$. Finally I asked it if the lifting $$p$$
could be

$$$$
p(f) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
  f = \text{Id}_X & \text{Id}_A \\
  f = \text{Id}_Y & \text{Id}_B
  \end{array}\right\}
$$$$

To which it said, ah, yes, that should work too:

> Apologies for the confusion caused by my previous incorrect

> identity morphism on Y (f = id_Y), then the fiber fib(f) is the
> object B in C, and the lifting p(f) is the identity morphism id_B: B

Concluding with:

<div class="multiline-quote">
The fiber $$\text{fib}(f)$$ for $$f$$ in $$C$$ is defined as follows:

* If $$f$$ is the identity morphism on $$X\ (f\ =\ id_X)$$, then the fiber $$\text{fib}(f)$$
  is the object $$A$$ in $$C$$.
* If $$f$$ is the identity morphism on $$Y\ (f\ =\ id_Y)$$, then the fiber $$\text{fib}(f)$$
  is the object $$B$$ in $$C$$.

To define the lifting $$p(f)$$ for $$f: X \to Y$$:

* If $$f$$ is the identity morphism on $$X (f = id_X)$$, then the lifting
  $$p(f)$$ is the identity morphism $$id_A: A \to A$$ in $$C$$.
* If $$f$$ is the identity morphism on $$Y (f = id_Y)$$, then the lifting
  $$p(f)$$ is the identity morphism $$id_B: B \to B$$ in $$C$$.
</div>

So if you're following along this far you may have noticed that,
because of ChatGPT's bad examples, I missed an important detail: $$f$$
is supposed to be $$X \to Y$$ in $$D$$---it can't be identities in
$$D$$! The only way this works is if in $$F$$'s domain category, there
is at least one morphism between $$A$$ and $$B$$. Here's the last
example that we arrived at together:

<div class="multiline-quote">
Consider the category $$C = \{A, B\}$$ with two objects $$A$$ and
$$B$$ and two non-identity morphisms $$f: A \to B$$ and $$g: A \to
B$$. Let $$D$$ be the category of sets.

Define a functor $$F: C \to D$$ as follows:

* $$F(A) = X$$, where $$X$$ is a set,
* $$F(B) = Y$$, where $$Y$$ is another set,
* $$F(f) = h: X \to Y$$, a function from $$X$$ to $$Y$$,
* $$F(g) = k: X \to Y$$, another function from $$X$$ to $$Y$$.

In this case, the functor $$F$$ maps objects $$A$$ and $$B$$ in $$C$$
to sets $$X$$ and $$Y$$ in $$D$$, respectively, and it maps the
non-identity morphisms $$f$$ and $$g$$ in $$C$$ to the functions $$h$$
and $$k$$ in $$D$$.

To show that $$F$$ is a fibration, let's consider a morphism $$f: X
\to Y$$ in $$D$$.

The fiber $$\text{fib}(f)$$ for $$f$$ in $$C$$ is defined as the
object $$A$$ in $$C$$.

To define the lifting $$p(f)$$ for $$f: X \to Y$$:

* If $$f$$ is the function $$h: X \to Y$$, the lifting $$p(f)$$ is the
  morphism $$f: A \to B$$ in $$C$$.
* If $$f$$ is the function $$k: X \to Y$$, the lifting $$p(f)$$ is the
  morphism $$g: A \to B$$ in $$C$$.

In both cases, applying $$F$$ to the lifting $$p(f)$$ yields the
original morphism $$f: X \to Y$$.

Therefore, the functor $$F: C \to D$$ is a fibration since, for every
morphism $$f: X \to Y$$ in $$D$$, the fiber $$\text{fib}(f) = A$$ in
$$C$$, and the lifting $$p(f)$$ satisfies $$F(p(f)) = f$$.  </div>

Which, as it states, satisfies $$F(p(f)) = f$$. I love that everything
ChatGPT does is in the format that written standardized tests in
middle school were required to be... "In conclusion, ..."

Anyway, we got there eventually, and now I feel like I actually know
what the hell a fibration is, and although it was an oblique route,
ChatGPT was yet again helpful.
