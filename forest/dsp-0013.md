A few years ago, as my first foray into philosophy as a Real Adult, I
attempt to power my way through Deleuze and Guattari's _AntiOedipus:
Capitalism and Schizophrenia_. It didn't go particularly well. I think
I understood that there was something revolutionary about it, about
escaping oppressive hierarchies imposed on us by the Oedipal Triangle,
but the lyrical language can be, at times, nearly impossible to
follow. I gave up about half-way through.

Last week, though, I went on tirade during a phone call with a friend
about the aforementioned pair's _What's Philosophy_, and the
juxtaposition of philosophy to aesthetics. To them, philosophy is the
aesthetics of _concepts_. Because I'm entitled to do so, I contributed
my interpretation of this notion: that philosophy doesn't tell us what
Is, or Should Be, but instead gives us lenses with which to view what
Has, Will, or Could. Philosophy is a **quiver of telescopes** that we
can use to view the world, discourse, existence, &c.; swapping them
out according to need, and adding cylinders to the ones we use most in
hopes to further their efficacy.
