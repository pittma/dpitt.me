<span class="para-begin"> In 2009</span>, Mark Fisher published
_Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?_ where he wrote that "it
is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the
end of capitalism." Amongst many other things (including a critical
viewing of Disney Pixar's _WALL-E_), Fisher updates historical
materialism for the modern world. If our experience is formed by our
material conditions, as opposed the Hegelian notion that ideas form
our conditions, then so too must our mental health be driven by the
structural issues inherent in unchecked neoliberalism. This isn't
driven by precarity alone; no, to Fisher, capitalism even codes our
desires, our identities. It would be Pescatarian[^fisher] to say that
_capitalism colonizes subjectivity_, which is to say it even defines
how we define ourselves. It enforces a normative form for the self—one
we could never obtain—while also trapping us, leaving us incapable of
seeing an alternative.

[^fisher]: In one of my corners of the Dark Forest, I asked how one
    would say "fisher-esque", the best response was _pescatarian_.

About 30 years before that, Deleuze wrote about the "Oedipal Triangle"
which—as he and Guattari were wont to do—was used as a illustration
for the normative power of Freudian psychoanalysis, the State, and the
family—three sides, completing the triangle. An Oedipalized individual
is under the influence of these three forces, he is formed by them
into a "productive member of society". This the the delineation of the
same forces that Fisher wrote about in _Capitalist Realism_. Deleuze
and Guattari, however, _could_ imagine an alternative, which they
deemed the Schizophrenic—the anti-oedipus—he is untethered, free in
thought and will, he's a nomad following a line of flight. D&G wrote
lyrically, like a fever dream, about an alternative to the normative
forces of capitalism and its epistemological gangsters. They gave this
radical state of being many names: the body without organs, the
schizophrenic, the nomad. D&G wanted to eke out an archetype without
overcoding it, to try and say how something felt without saying what
it was. It's helpful to think of their writing like poetry because
this is its task: expressing the inutterable, leaving the ripples of a
vibe on the surface of thought. The strictures of writing about the
ineffable prevented them from saying in clear terms what an
alternative would be, but nevertheless, they spent their much of
careers vacillating around the idea that there was one, and that its
pursuit was the pursuit of freedom.

About 70 years before that, Tolstoy was writing about these normative
forces as well, briefly in _On Anarchy_, but extensively in _The Law
of Love and the Law of Violence_. He was on the heels of Engels' and
Marx's writings on anarchy and communism, he was vehemently anti-war,
and he found himself trying to reconcile his reading of Jesus'
teachings with the hermeneutics of the Church. His reading was radical
and resulted in his excommunication. In Tolstoy's mind, the very
ontology of the State **is** violence, while at the same time, the
prevailing message of Christ is in dialectical opposition to that: a
message of anti-violence, of love.

What we would call today Trotskyist—the belief that when the
proletariat revolution has succeeded, there will no longer need to be
a State—is not dissimilar, structurally, to Tolstoy's vision. In _The
Law of Love and the Law of Violence_ he wrote[^tolst1]:

[^tolst1]: [_The Law of Love and the Law of
    Violence_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/leo-tolstoy-the-law-of-violence-and-the-law-of-love?v=1627426747#toc21)

> [T]he eternal spirit that penetrates each and every one of us in unity
> and fills us with the ambition to attain that which we ought; it is
> the same spirit that urges the tree to grow towards the sun, the
> flower to drop its seeds in autumn, and which urges us to strive after
> God, thereby uniting ourselves. [..] Salvation does not lie in the
> rituals and profession of faith, but in a clear understanding of the
> meaning of our life.

In _On Anarchy_, he elaborates on what that he believes the pursuit of
that meaning leads to[^tolst2].

[^tolst2]: [_On
    Anarchy_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/leo-tolstoy-on-anarchy)

> But what should be done, I do unmistakably know. And if you ask:
> “What will happen?”, then I reply that good will certainly happen;
> because, acting in the way indicated by reason and love, I am acting

> its instrument. One course therefore remains—to fight the
> Government by means of thought, speech, actions, life, neither
> yielding to Government nor joining its ranks and thereby increasing
> its power.

To Tolstoy, the armature of revolution is love.

As I mentioned above, around this time Marx wrote about the end of the
State post-revolution, wherein the proletariat seize control from the
bourgeoisie and eradicate the idea of it. Marxism, in its original
form, was teleological; the goal wasn't to simply raise up the
proletariat and defeat the bourgeoisie, it was to erase class
altogether. I won't elaborate much further on Marxism here, as
thousands of gallons of ink and millions of bits have been spilled on
the topic (the four thinkers above and few dozen between them
notwithstanding) but I wanted to underscore the Marxist idea of
permanent revolution because it's crucial to our quest. It's a key
precept in Marxian logic and its modern, most orthodox
adherents. Materially, it refers to the fact that a socialist
revolution requires an interminable revolt against the forces of
capitalism, a vigilance unending. I'll leave it there for now, but the
takeaway here is that the only successful revolution is one that goes
forever.

Just shy of two millennia before that, Jesus was giving warnings about
what happens when these normative forces are met with resistance.

> Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have
> not come to bring peace, but a sword.

What Jesus is saying here isn't about violence, it's about
radicalism[^sword]. The sword isn't literal, it's a metaphor for
division: the two references you find at this verse in the NRSV are
Luke 12:51-52[^lk12], and Mark 13:12, both of which state the division
literally.

[^sword]: I think an alternative reading could be the "Armor of God"
    where the sword is the Word, but this works too: Jesus' message of
    radicalism is polemical, an inherent source of division.

[^lk12]: Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth?
    No, I tell you, but rather division! From now on five in one
    household will be divided, three against two and two against
    three[.]

Let's take it a little further. The most on the nose example has to be
Acts 2:44-45[^marx]:

[^marx]: Just as Marx said about 2000 years later, "from each
    according to his ability to each according to his need."


> All who believed were together and had all things in common; they
> would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds
> to all, as any had need.

Jesus' teachings were radical in nature, he was aware of this
radicalization, and he talked about it directly. Unfortunately for
Christian Nationalist weirdos, Matthew 10:34 isn't a call to arms;
it's a warning about the effects of committing to a cause, because he
knew these effects have no limits. As the story goes, the Romans left
it up to his own people to decide his fate, and they chose to kill him
for his aberrations. He knew what would happen, and tought that
message of love and community anyway. It is through Tolstoy that I
begin to see that Jesus' message is the missing alternative. A quiet
revolution.

Mia Hansen-Løve's wonderful film _Things to Come_ is about this quiet
radicalism that I'm circling here. The film follows a middle-aged high
school philosophy teacher, Nathalie, whose life is turned upside down
when her husband decides to leave her. The most affecting part of the
film, though, is the thinking she does as she reorients after this
change in her trajectory. This culminates in a debate with a former
student who's hit the eject button on life by joining a commune in the
mountains. She sees him as having a selfish and impotent vantage on
radicalism. After seeing a copy of Ted Kaczynski‘s manifesto on his
bookshelf, she tells him, "I hope you place more value on human life."
While pushing against those normative forces, yes, her student did so
while denying the resposibilty he had to his fellow man. Why turn
yourself inside out if you're the only one to benefit from it?

Radicalism is the reification of an absolute ideology. As we get
older, or at least as I get older, that conviction is alloyed by
nuance—black and white become grey through dilution. This does not
pollute utopia’s purity nor does it change our (again, my) fundamental
belief about what’s necessary to get there, but it does ground my
expectations in the material. That’s what Hansen-Løve is trying to
communicate through Nathalie. As you reach middle age, you have two
choices—quiet radicalism made intergenerational by conferring a moral
system and its sources to our children or to others’ as an educator,
or to eject and start an anarchist commune in the mountains. We
valorize the latter but it’s the former that gives me hope. That moral
system must be one rooted in brotherly love, turning towards one
another, and a constant vigilance for care. This requires the
permanent revolution of the self. When our material conditions impel
us to individuate, there is revolution in community.
