In 2009, Mark Fisher published _Capitalist Realism: Is There No
Alternative?_ where he wrote about how "it is easier to imagine the
end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism." Amongst
many other things (including a critical viewing of Disney Pixar's
_WALL-E_), Fisher updates historical materialism for the modern
world. If our experience is formed by our material conditions, as
opposed the Hegelian notion that ideas form our conditions, then so
too must our mental health be driven by the structural issues inherent
in unchecked neoliberalism. This isn't driven by precarity alone; no,
to Fisher, capitalism even codes our desires, our identities. It would
be pescatarian[^fisher] to say that _capitalism colonizes
subjectivity_, which is to say it even defines how we define
ourselves. It enforces a normative form for the self—one we could
never obtain—while also trapping us, leaving us incapable of seeing an
alternative.

[^fisher]: In one of my corners of the Dark Forest, I asked how one
    would say "fisher-esque", the best response was _pescatarian_.

Before that, Deleuze wrote about the "Oedipal Triangle" in
Anti-Oedipus, which—as he and Guattari often would—was used as a
synecdoche for the normative power of Freudian psychoanalysis, but
also the State and the family, three sides, completing the
triangle. An oedipalized individual was under the influence of these
three forces, a productive member of society, while the
schizophrenic—the anti-oedipus—is untethered, free in thought and
will, a nomad following a line of flight. D&G wrote lyrically, like
fever dream, about an alternative to the normative forces of
capitalism and its figurative epistemological gangsters and gave this
state of being several names: the body without organs, the
schizophrenic, the nomad. I think it would be safe to say that Deleuze
wanted to eke out an archetype without overcoding it, to try and say
how something felt without saying what it was. This limitation, to be
explicitly writing about the ineffable, prevented D&G from saying what
in clear terms what an alternative would be, but they spent their
whole careers vacillating around the idea that there was one, and its
pursuit was the pursuit of freedom.

Before that, Tolstoy wrote about state being an apparatus for violence
and that the prevailing message of Christ was one of anti-violence,
briefly in _On Anarchy_, but extensively in _The Law of Violence and
the Law of Love_, he imagined a world without a need for the State,
one animated by philadelphia rather than violence.

Before that, Marx wrote about the end of the State post-revolution,
wherein the proletariat seize control from the bourgeoisie and
eradicate it. Marxism, in its original form, was teleological; the
goal wasn't to simply raise up the proletariat and defeat the
bourgeoisie, it was to erase class altogether. To Marx, for this to be
possible, there must be _permanent revolution_.

Before that, Jesus said:

> Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have
> not come to bring peace, but a sword.

The sword here isn't literal, it's a metaphor for division: the two
references you find at this verse in the NRSV are Luke
12:51-52[^lk12], and Mark 13:12, both of which make literal that
division. What Jesus is saying here isn't about violence, it's about
radicalism[^sword], about revolution.

[^lk12]: Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth?
    No, I tell you, but rather division! From now on five in one
    household will be divided, three against two and two against
    three[.]

[^sword]: I think an alternative reading could be the "Armor of God"
    where the sword is the Word, but this works too: Jesus' message of
    radicalism is polemical, an inherent source of division.

Let's take it a little further. I think the most on the nose example
has to be Acts 2:44-45:

> All who believed were together and had all things in common; they
> would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds
> to all, as any had need.

The early church was explicitly communalist, and there are plenty of
other allusions to the Marxist inversion of power such as Luke 1:52-53
and 6:20-26, even the strange parable about the laborers in the
vineyard in Matthew 20 where the vineyard owner pays each laborer
equally whether they worked all day or a single hour has the patina of
radical fairness.

So I've buried the lede. What we're seeing here, if we look forwards
rather than backwards as I have intentionally done here, we see a form
of radical love, explicitly stated to be divisive and revolutionary
slowly lose its attainability the further we're steeped into a
precarious existence. I do not intend to project Jesus' material
conditions 2000 years into the future to be our own, rather I'm asking
you to consider whether perhaps we ought to interpret that
2000-year-old message as one about personal revolution as Tolstoy did.
When our material conditions impel us to individuate, there is
revolution in community.

> And this is the will of God, the teaching of Christ. There can be
> only one permanent revolution — a moral one: the regeneration of the
> inner man. How is this revolution to take place? Nobody knows how it
> will take place in humanity, but every man feels it clearly in
> himself. And yet in our world everybody thinks of changing humanity,
> and nobody thinks of changing himself.
