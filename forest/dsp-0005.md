title: Notes on existing as a leaf in a world of cars

You’re driving.

A leaf falls from a tree near the side of the road.

You’re uniquely positioned for insight into its path as it cascades
down and collides with your windshield. It slides up and to the
left. Out of view. There are no tangible after-effects on you or the
vehicle. You drive on, unaffected, unaware of the change of course
you’ve just abruptly imposed.

I am that leaf.

We are that leaf.

Existing in a world of cars.

Be kind.
