Emphasis mine.

In _The History of Western Philosophy_, Bertrand Russell’s analysis of
Frankenstein is a bore:

> Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein […] contains what might almost be
> regarded as an allegorical prophetic history of the development of
> Romanticism.

This hygienic take leaves Shelley only capable of thinking within the
confines of her epoch — Romanticism’s box — and not as a human, as a
woman, in her own right. As Lepore points out, between the time of the
novel’s commencement and its publishing, Shelley was pregnant four
times and buried three of those four. By this account, Frankenstein’s
nameless monster can be none other than the hell that is loss, the
malignancy of an existence acutely felt by a woman reconciling a
triptych of identity as mother, wife, and artist.

Lepore also calls out The Monster’s ambivalence about his
epistemological journey, wherein he considers it a curse to have
learned to read, only to use that ability to read of his mistreatment
in Frankenstein’s journals. Like Derrida’s specter, neither he nor
Shelley can return to an existence prior to the knowledge—and the
pain that that knowledge causes—of catastrophic loss. This part of
Russell’s analysis I do like, as he plucks out The Monster’s monologue
as he stands over Frankenstein’s body:

> That also is my victim! in his murder my crimes are consummated; the
> miserable genius of my being is wound to its close! Oh,
> Frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail
> that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed
> thee by destroying all that thou lovedst. Alas! he is cold, he
> cannot answer me. . . . When I run over the frightful catalogue of
> my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts
> were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty
> and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel
> becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had
> friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.

Existence is solitary, wishful, and unforgiving.
