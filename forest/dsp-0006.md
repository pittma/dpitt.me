This is a thing I do. I like to learn things by finding the thing I
want to learn, and then work my way down as I encounter unknowns,
exposing layers like an epistemological onion â€” a truth vegetable.

The current outermost layer is Homotopy Type Theory which is put forth
by [the HoTT Book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/). Per usual,
as I dig down beneath the _tunic_ I'm reminded that, for all intents
and purposes, I know nothing and I spiral out of control wiki link
after wiki link, my only respite a term I actually understand. It
could be argued that this is called "learning", but that label is
dubious.

### Homotopy

Digressions aside, Homotopy is, in my best attempt at lucidity, a
continuous function that can map between two functions, say $$f,g: A
\rightarrow B$$ mapping from the same space to another same space. If
this function exists, and we'll call it $$H$$, then those two maps are
homotopic. Formally, it looks like this:

$$$$
f, g: A \rightarrow B \\
H: A \times [0, 1] \rightarrow B \\
H(x, 0) = f(x) \\
H(x, 1) = g(x)
$$$$

To put this in English: We've convered the first line.  That's our two
maps: $$f$$ and $$g$$. The second line is illustrating the what $$H$$
maps: the _product_ of $$X$$ and the unit interval to $$B$$. A product
in this case means _and_. As a quick explanation of product in this
context, we can refer to some Haskell:

```haskell
-- This is a sum type, i.e. an or. Meaning a Maybe' can be either a Just' a or
-- Nothing.
data Maybe' a = Just' a | Nothing'

-- While this is a product, an and. The tuple is the product of something of
-- type a and something of type b.
data Tuple' a b = (a, b)
```

The unit interval however, is another scale to the onion.

The unit interval is the set of all the real numbers between $$0$$ and
$$1$$. We use the bounds of this interval to be equal to our two maps
given some $$x$$. This means that our $$H$$, our homotopy, is a
function which through a transfinite series of inputs can "bend" $$f$$
into $$g$$.

That, in a nutshell is homotopy. But, as I delved deeper, like
anything worth learning, that nascent intuition was simply a
prerequisite.

### Univalence

__Univalence Axiom__: $$(A = B) \approx (A \approx B)$$.

The book says this about Univalence:


It goes on to say that Univalence is informally an equivalence, and
more specifcally _homotopy equivalence_. Homotopy equivalence is given
by an isomorphism between two spaces where the following holds:

Given spaces $$X$$ and $$Y$$ and maps $$f: X \rightarrow; Y$$ and $$g:
Y \rightarrow X$$, the composition $$f \circ g$$ is homotopic to
$$Id_X$$ and the composition $$g \circ f$$ is homotopic to $$Id_Y$$.

To put this is another way, and how I actually wrote this down in my
notebook when I was searching for the intuition: Univalence is a
topological bijection and that bijection is a valid isomorphism in the
domain of pure topology.  There's a inside joke about topologists:
Toplogists can't tell the difference between a donut and a coffee mug.
This is precisely why!  The torus (donut) is homotopy equivalent,
i.e. isomorphic, to a coffee mug.

So, when we talk about univalence in the context of Homotopy, we're
talking about a form of equality, an isomorphism.

This concludes the initial desiderata for grappling with Homotopy Type
Theory, or at least its introduction.  There's more to come, for the
both of us.
