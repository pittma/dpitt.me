# I.

When I turned 18, I stopped going to church. I was in the throes of a
personal revolution. Not just because 18 is a revolutionary age, but
also because I had recently discovered punk rock---punk rock and sex
to be fair---and as I oriented my life around the former, I still
retained the belief that, after nearly a decade of purity culture,
Jesus and the latter were incompatible; and like any rational 18
year-old, I went with the more tangible religious experience. Most of
my friends left the church over the next few years, there's only one
or two I can think of that stayed for the long haul. There was a short
stint of time when I mirrored their anger because it was Punk, or,
more likely, to mask the guilt I felt when I left enough room for my
feelings, but either way, the anger never felt real. In fact, anger
and aggression have never really been my thing, I've always been more
of a sad boi---generally against violence of any form.

Over the last 20+ years, I've dipped my toes back in Christianity for
a week or two, once for nearly a year between the time O and T were
born, but the truth is, I've always been turned off by the church's
politics, and despite the revolutionary potential in Jesus' teachings,
the church has always been a bastion of the Right who has become
increasingly insane over the last decade. I have instead sought out
religious experiences elsewhere which I have [written
about](/forest/dsp-0028.html) more [than once](/forest/dsp-0023.html).

If you're Online in a similar way to me, or perhaps know what
Politigram is, you may have encountered people with insane Christian
Nationalist political opinions with "Matthew 10:34" in their profile.
Well this is Matthew 10:34[^nrsv]:

[^nrsv]: NRSV, as are all other verse copied below unless stated
    otherwise.

> Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have
> not come to bring peace, but a sword.

Jesus is talking to his disciples here, sending them out, "Go nowhere
among the Gentiles, and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, proclaim the good
news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’" The reason you see this
reference used in these environments is because people like to
cherry-pick this verse out of context and use it as evidence that
Jesus was pro-violence, that violence is justified and
necessary. Fortunately, there is another interpretation, one that
nullifies the logical contradictions that we'd have to overlook
otherwise. The sword here isn't literal, it's a metaphor for division:
the two references you find at this verse in the NRSV are Luke
12:51-52[^lk12], and Mark 13:12, both of which make literal that
division. What Jesus is saying here isn't about violence, it's about
radicalism[^sword].

[^lk12]: Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth?
    No, I tell you, but rather division! From now on five in one
    household will be divided, three against two and two against
    three[.]

[^sword]: I think an alternative reading could be the "Armor of God"
    where the sword is the Word, but this works too: Jesus' message of
    radicalism is polemical, an inherent source of division.


On the heals of Marx, Tolstoy started to see Jesus' radicalism in this
way, which he wrote about in _On Anarchy_ (1900)[^tolj]:

[^tolj]: I'm sure this is expanded on in _The Kingdom is of God is
    Within You_, but I have not read it yet.
	
> The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the
> existing order and in the assertion that, without Authority there
> could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing
> conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that anarchy can be
> instituted by a violent revolution. But it will be instituted only
> by there being more and more people who do not require the
> protection of governmental power and by there being more and more
> people who will be ashamed of applying this power.

Anarchy, to Tolstoy, seems to mean the absence of a State, but one
should note that this was Marx's goal too. If the power was in the
hands of the proletariat, Marx thought the state would no longer need
to exist---in Marxism, the State is a tool of violence wielded by the
bourgeoisie. Under this reading, specifically via, "**But it will be
instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require
the protection of governmental power and by there being more and more
people who will be ashamed of applying this power**" Tolstoy is
alluding to the individual as a part of the collective, an
individual's _personal revolution_. Tolstoy's piece ends with the
famous quote, "everybody thinks of changing humanity, and nobody
thinks of changing themselves." It's hard to argue that this wasn't
Jesus' teaching all along, this radical transformation of the inner
man.

But what was Jesus teaching? How does one connect those teachings to
what Tolstoy said above about the inversion of power that Marx talked
about just a few years before? I think the most on the nose example
has to be Acts 2:44-45:

> All who believed were together and had all things in common; they
> would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds
> to all, as any had need.

The early church was explicitly communalist, and there are plenty of
other allusions to the inversion of power such as Luke 1:52-53 and
6:20-26, even the strange parable about the laborers in the vineyard
in Matthew 20 where the vineyard owner pays each laborer equally
whether they worked all day or a single hour has the patina of radical
fairness.

Deleuze wrote about the "Oedipal Triangle" in Anti-Oedipus, which---as
he and Guattari often did---was used as a synecdoche for the normative
power of Freudian psychoanalysis, but also the State and the family,
three sides, completing the triangle. An oedipalized individual was
under the influence of these three forces, a productive member of
society, while the schizophrenic---the anti-oedipus---is untethered,
free in thought and will, a nomad following a line of flight.

Before that, Tolstoy wrote about state being an apparatus for violence
and that the prevailing message of Christ was one of anti-violence,
briefly in _On Anarchy_, but extensively in _The Law of Violence and
the Law of Love_, he imagined a world without a need for the State,
one animated by philadelphia rather than violence.

Before that, Marx wrote about the end of the State post-revolution,
wherein the proletariat seize control from the bourgeoisie and
eradicate it. Marxism, in its original form, was teleological; the
goal wasn't to simply raise up the proletariat and defeat the
bourgeoisie, it was to erase class altogether. To Marx, for this to be
possible, there must be _permanent revolution_.

Before that, Jesus said:

> Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have
> not come to bring peace, but a sword.

The sword here isn't literal, it's a metaphor for division: the two
references you find at this verse in the NRSV are Luke
12:51-52[^lk12], and Mark 13:12, both of which make literal that
division. What Jesus is saying here isn't about violence, it's about
radicalism[^sword], about revolution.

[^lk12]: Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth?
    No, I tell you, but rather division! From now on five in one
    household will be divided, three against two and two against
    three[.]

[^sword]: I think an alternative reading could be the "Armor of God"
    where the sword is the Word, but this works too: Jesus' message of
    radicalism is polemical, an inherent source of division.

Let's take it a little further. I think the most on the nose example
has to be Acts 2:44-45:

> All who believed were together and had all things in common; they
> would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds
> to all, as any had need.

The early church was explicitly communalist, and there are plenty of
other allusions to the Marxist inversion of power such as Luke 1:52-53
and 6:20-26, even the strange parable about the laborers in the
vineyard in Matthew 20 where the vineyard owner pays each laborer
equally whether they worked all day or a single hour has the patina of
radical fairness.

This "apocalyptic hope" is oft mentioned in Karen Armstrong's _History
of God_, but—at least in what I've read—she doesn't necessarily
connect the dots here (probably because she is not a socialist), but
I'm curious if maybe I'm missing something in her writing…

yes, in the spirit of slave spirituals coming out of the American
south before the end of slavery as I understood it. It is interesting,
though, to connect her transcendence ideal to Tolstoy's writing in _On
anarchy_ for example.

now I'm going schizo because I think there may be a connection from
Jesus to Deleuze via Tolstoy. Would this notion of No State not be an
instance of the eradication of the oedipal triangle created by the
state?

I often forget that the [re|de]territorialization does not have a
moral bound. We can reterritorialize things with our own morality just
the same as someone else can reterritorialize, e.g. Matthew 10:34 to
mean a call for physical violence.

I always thought "schizophrenia" in D&G's parlance was just the
pinnacle of the various literary devices they used to talk about
existing outside the precepts of "societal norms", chosen
strategically as a figurative fuck you to Freud, who they saw as an
apparatus of the State.

Okay, so when Mark Fisher talks about the material conditions involved
in our mental health, rather than just some neurochemistry imbalance,
is this a modern example of materialism? And would the same dialectic
apply (bourgeois v proletariat)? I guess so…

Say more about capital colonizing subjectivity. Meaning that capital
applies pressure on individuation?

A normative form, I assume (re form of the subject)? And that
normativity is what leaves us to believe there is no alternative? If
so, I can see how this connects to D&G’s BwO—it is the BwO, the
schizo, who _can_ see an alternative.
