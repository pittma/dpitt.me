Radical and terrifying. The book opens with a Deleuze quote, and (of
course) I can't help but think about through that lens. The House is a
palpable and properly insidious expression of the Oedipal triangle,
and it represents all that Deleuze and Guattari originally intended:
gender and sexual normativity, fascism, the strictures of societal
expectations and so on. In a pair of words, Freudian
psychoanalysis. Rumfitt gives her representation of this mental,
sexual, and societal cell the weight that it requires; to her, it's
not an observation from the relatively safe space of the 1970s like
D&G's was. No, she knows how dangerous and real The House is. _Tell Me
I'm Worthless_ is presentiment, not in language but in
feeling. Portentous, not through data or rationality, but through
fear. It evinces the existential terror we all felt on January 6th—we
saw irrefutable truth that fascism is here, and real—but Rumfitt does
it through the lens of someone whose whole life has been ruddered by
that terror. She viscerally illustrates that fascism is the cop inside
your head and is asking you to, in the words of Boston hardcore band
Move, "kill the cop inside your head, decarcerate your mind."
