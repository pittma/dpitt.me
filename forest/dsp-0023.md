Ben Lerner, _The Topeka School_

Language is a tool for communication. But for it to be a tool that can
act as a medium, that tool must be concomitant with a set of agreed
upon rules. Creating something to countenance a set of predetermined
rules such as these is a form of formalization. The rules we use to
communicate, such as punctuation, sentence structure and so on, all
fall under the umbrella of syntax. Formalization like this is hard,
because signifying an intuition with a syntax is inherently a limiting
action. Ideas, intuitions, emotions, all of these exist in a
continuous space, unbroken by the limiting and discretizing force of
syntax. When we attempt to relate an idea via speech or writing, that
continuous space must be reduced into differentiable pieces. Deleuze
and Guattari wrote about this phenomenon and termed it
“territorializing”. To get a grip on their concept, think of a
pristine, undiscovered continent. Upon discovery, its (assumption:
capitalist) discoverers break the land up arbitrarily such that it may
be classified as states, countries, counties, or even parcels of land
to be sold. This is a material example of territorializing. But
Deleuze and Guattari didn’t stop there—they abstracted
territorializing and found limitless applications. Language itself is
a territorializer to our thoughts. Their most famous work, the
Capitalism and Schizophrenia series, discusses a “critical
schizophrenia”. A concept which can be weaponized to mean a lot of
things, like the justification for heterodoxical ideologies, but at
its core, it is a rejection of Freudian psychoanalysis. They saw
Freud’s battle with schizophrenia to truly be about the assimilation
of the analysand. D&G’s critical schizophrenia refers to the
untethered and unassimilated analysand—to a mind
deterritorialized. Language, you see, according to Deleuze and
Guattari, is a gilded cage for your thoughts.

D&G’s isn’t the only attempt to articulate such a phenomenon. It,
albeit in different terms, is also discussed in Bernard Steigler’s
book _For a New Critique of Political Economy_. Steigler makes the
point that the very act of writing a practice down, i.e.,
externalizing it from one’s mind, is a tool for oppression. His
argument is that _hypomnesis_, the exteriorization of memory, induces
the possibility of a management class. Hypomnesis’ antonym,
_anamnesis_, refers to internalized recollection or reference, without
the need for external aids. In a world primarily driven by anamnesis,
each generation learns its trade, its means for survival, from the one
that came before it. Knowledge is passed down directly, its purpose is
for the survival and the flourishing of generations to come. The point
that Stiegler is trying to make is that hypomnesis is how a managerial
class can invent itself, without the abstraction of exteriorization
there cannot be the abstraction of a managerial class; the two are
inextricably combined. Steigler’s is a Marxist argument: the
territorialization of generational knowledge is a cornerstone in
separating real value from use value, precisely through that
generative abstraction.

I think Steigler is right w/r/t grammatization (his term for what
we’ve been calling territorializing, which actually comes from
Derrida’s reading of Plato) being a crucial tool for the oppression of
the working class, however, his theory’s veracity is in my opinion,
governed by the intent of the grammarizer. If you take Steigler’s
argument as I understand it to its terminus, you arrive at a kind of
ludditic anarcho-primitivism. This is in contradiction with a
different type of syntax, the syntax of mathematics, whose goal is to
universalize access to precise information. When we externalize a
mathematical thought through syntax, it isn’t for oppression, it’s to
_verify_. Without a reduction in fidelity, nothing could be checked;
not just because verification inherently entails exteriorization, but
also because to verify infinity, you would first need to calculate
it. However, if we can signify infinity in the finite through syntax,
we can verify it as well. In fact, we can even ask a computer to
verify it for us by presenting the computer its own syntax—a set of
rules—which can be used to interpret and then validate the syntax
we’ve input. This is of course something a computer can do faster and
with greater precision than we can as humans for many reasons, not the
least of which is that a computer does not suffer the loss of fidelity
or struggle to discretize intuition because its entire existence is
resident in the world of syntax. What is a computer besides a
territorializer of electrons, anyway?

An example: The notion that a + b = b + a is something we intuitively
know, we’ve known it since not long after we learned addition. This
law is called commutativity, it generalizes the idea of flipping
operands and ending up with the same result. Below is a proof of the
commutativity of addition on the natural numbers.

```agda
+-identᵣ : ∀ (a : ℕ) → a + zero ≡ a
+-identᵣ zero = refl
+-identᵣ (succ a) = cong succ (+-identᵣ a)

+-succ : ∀ (a b : ℕ) → (succ a) + b ≡ a + (succ b)
+-succ zero b =  refl
+-succ (succ a) b = cong succ (+-succ a b)

+-comm : ∀ (a b : ℕ) → a + b ≡ b + a
+-comm zero b = sym (+-identᵣ b)
+-comm (succ a) b = trans (cong succ (+-comm a b)) (+-succ b a)
```

This proof, in a way, calculates infinity. The natural numbers are,
after all, an infinite set. The last stanza, those three lines that
begin with +-comm, comprise the commutativity proof, the other two
stanzas are subproofs needed to prove the final proof. This, to me, is
irrefutable evidence of the limiting nature of syntax. It’s through
syntax, with which we signify infinity, that we can begin to wrestle
with it.

Another almost-articulation of this is Kant’s analytic and synthetic
divide. I’ll quote the
[SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/):

> “Analytic” sentences, such as “Pediatricians are doctors,” have
> historically been characterized as ones that are true by virtue of the
> meanings of their words alone and/or can be known to be so solely by
> knowing those meanings. They are contrasted with more usual
> “synthetic” sentences, such as “Pediatricians are rich,” (knowledge
> of) whose truth depends also upon (knowledge of) the worldly fortunes
> of pediatricians.

What we have above is an _analytic_ proof of the commutativity of
addition. Its _synthetic_ proof, one more representative of our
intuition, would require infinite time and infinite resources. The
synthetic proof requires us to run every possible combination of pairs
of natural numbers, effectively squaring infinity. Now, obviously,
synthetic / analytic are not the same as the phenomenon of syntax’s
discretizing force. It would of course still be syntax that we’d use
to calculate infinity if we had infinite time to calculate it. Like
the sentences you’re reading here, we’d be using syntax to bridle
infinity. My goal instead is to articulate that all of these concepts
are related, somehow, but that we lack the medium through which to
elucidate exactly how. The notion of an unobtainable medium evinces
St. Anselm’s argument for the existence of God (again, from the
[SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/)):

> St. Anselm reasoned that, if such a being fails to exist, then a
> greater being—namely, a being than which no greater can be conceived,
> and which exists—can be conceived. But this would be absurd: nothing
> can be greater than a being than which no greater can be conceived. So
> a being than which no greater can be conceived—i.e., God—exists.

St. Anselm’s ontological argument makes the case that God is that
unattainable medium. It’s a medium, a being, a notion, a thought
that’s unscratchable by our feeble minds. It’s this that makes art
feel holy. It’s this that motivates why grappling with the foundations
of math ensnares me in such a way that I can lose time, whole hours,
when I’m given to its chase. It’s this that is the explanation for the
chill I’m feeling as I type this—I’m reaching out to something I
cannot see but am absolutely compelled by. Something I can only
picture through a glass, darkly. The pursuance of God.
