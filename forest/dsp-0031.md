This site uses the static site generator
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and [Edward Tufte's Sidenote
CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) by way of [Pandoc
Sidenote](https://github.com/jez/pandoc-sidenote). You can find the
source for it [here](https://github.com/pittma/dpitt.me).

It is a forest. Related items are linked to one another rather than
adhering to a chronological order; I think that's the best way to find
your way around. You can literally follow my trains of thought.
