<p>I'm dan and this is my website. Here you can find some long
form(-ish) posts:</p>

$partial("templates/post-list.html")$

<p>You can find older posts in the <a href="/archive/">archive</a>.</p>

<p>Or you can find a few talks I've done <a href="/talks/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you're feeling brave, you can see
the <a href="/newsletter">newsletter<a> which is significantly more
rambling. Sign up <a href="https://pittma.substack.com">here</a>.</p>
